- Nested loops

### 2. More Advanced Data Structures

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Common operations on data structures

### 3. Working with Files

- Reading from and writing to files
- Different file modes
- Using `with` statement for file handling

- Basic usage of external libraries

## Project: Hangman Game

In this project, you will implement a simple text-based Hangman game. This will allow you to practice using loops, working with lists and strings, and applying conditional statements.

#### Requirements:

1. Choose a random word from a predefined list.
2. Display the initial state of the word with underscores for unknown letters.
3. Allow the user to guess a letter.
4. Update the display to show correctly guessed letters and track incorrect guesses.
5. Implement logic to determine if the user has won or lost.

#### Bonus:

- Add a limit to the number of incorrect guesses allowed.
- Create a more extensive word list or implement a way to fetch words from an external source.
- Improve the user interface by displaying the hangman figure as incorrect guesses accumulate.

**Tip:** You can use the `random` module to generate a random number or choose a random item from a list.
