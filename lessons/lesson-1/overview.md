## Project: Simple Calculator

In this project, you will create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The goal is to apply the concepts learned in this lesson to build a functional and interactive Python program.

#### Requirements:

1. Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Take user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
3. Display the result of the chosen operation.

#### Bonus:

- Add error handling to handle invalid input, such as non-numeric values.
- Expand the calculator to include additional mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
