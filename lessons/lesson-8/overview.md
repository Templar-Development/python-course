# Lesson-8 | Ensuring Code Quality

## Topics

### 1. Testing Basics (unittest or pytest)

- Introduction to unit testing
- Writing and running basic test cases
- Test fixtures and test suites

### 2. Debugging Techniques

- Identifying and fixing common errors
- Using print statements for debugging
- Utilizing debugging tools (e.g., pdb)

## Project: Testing and Debugging

In this project, you will focus on ensuring code quality through testing and debugging.

#### Part 1: Testing with unittest or pytest

1. Write test cases for functions from previous projects (e.g., calculator, hangman game).
2. Execute the tests and ensure all cases pass.

#### Part 2: Debugging

1. Introduce intentional bugs into a small program.
2. Use debugging techniques (print statements, debugging tools) to identify and fix the issues.

#### Bonus:

- Explore more advanced testing concepts (e.g., mocking) and debugging tools.
- Implement test coverage analysis to ensure thorough testing.

**Tip:** You can find the documentation for unittest here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html and pytest here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
