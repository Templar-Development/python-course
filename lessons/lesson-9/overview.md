# Lesson-9 | Python Advanced Concepts

## Topics

### 1. Decorators

- Understanding decorators and their use cases
- Creating and applying decorators
- Decorators with arguments

### 2. Generators

- Introduction to generators
- Using the `yield` statement
- Generator expressions

### 3. Concurrency Basics (Threads and/or Multiprocessing)

- Overview of concurrency
- Threading in Python
- Multiprocessing in Python

## Project: Advanced Python Concepts

In this project, you will implement advanced Python concepts to enhance your coding skills.

#### Part 1: Decorators

1. Create a set of functions to be used as decorators.
2. Apply decorators to functions in a sample program.

#### Part 2: Generators

1. Implement a generator that generates a sequence of prime numbers.
2. Use the generator to perform a task, such as finding the sum of the first 100 prime numbers.

#### Part 3: Concurrency

1. Explore threading or multiprocessing by parallelizing a task.
2. Compare the performance with and without concurrency.

#### Bonus:

- Combine decorators and generators in a more complex program.
- Experiment with different concurrency scenarios and measure their impact on performance.

**Tip**: You can find the documentation for the `threading` module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html and the `multiprocessing` module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html
