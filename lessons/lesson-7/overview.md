## Project: Simple Database Interaction

In this project, you will apply your knowledge of databases by creating a Python program that interacts with a database.

#### Requirements:

1. Create a SQLite database with a table of your choice (e.g., for storing user information).
2. Write Python functions to perform CRUD operations on the database.
3. Implement a simple user interface in the console to interact with the database.

#### Bonus:

- Implement error handling for database operations.
- Explore more advanced database concepts, such as indexing and transactions.

**Tip:** You can find the documentation for the `sqlite3` module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
