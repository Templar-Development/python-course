# Lesson-4 | Python Beyond the Basics

## Topics

### 1. Modules and Packages

- Organizing code into modules
- Creating and using packages
- Importing modules and packages

### 2. Virtual Environments

- Understanding the need for virtual environments
- Creating and activating virtual environments
- Managing dependencies with `requirements.txt`

### 3. Introduction to External Libraries

- Exploring popular external libraries
- Installing external libraries using pip
- Basic usage of NumPy for numerical operations

## Project: Using External Libraries - NumPy

In this project, you will apply your knowledge of external libraries by working with NumPy, a powerful library for numerical operations in Python.

#### Requirements:

1. Install NumPy using pip.
2. Create a program that generates and manipulates arrays using NumPy.
3. Perform basic numerical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) on arrays.
4. Explore and demonstrate some advanced features of NumPy.

#### Bonus:

- Investigate and implement array manipulation functions provided by NumPy.
- Create a simple data visualization using NumPy arrays and Matplotlib.

**Tip:** You can find the documentation for NumPy here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
