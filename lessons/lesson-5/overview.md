## Project: Text Processing with Regular Expressions

In this project, you will apply regular expressions to perform text processing tasks. This will enhance your understanding of pattern matching and the practical use of regular expressions in Python.

#### Requirements:

1. Create a program that validates and processes user-inputted text using regular expressions.
2. Implement regex patterns to validate email addresses, phone numbers, or other user-defined patterns.
3. Use regex to extract specific information from a given text.

#### Bonus:

- Apply regular expressions to search and replace text in a file.
- Explore more complex regex patterns for advanced text processing tasks.

**Tip:** You can find the documentation for the `re` module here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html and you can test your regex patterns here: https://regex101.com/
